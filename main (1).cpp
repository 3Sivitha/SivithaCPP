/*WEATHER APP (BACKEND CODE)

NAME:G.SIVITHA
COLLEGE NAME:V.S.B. ENGINEERING COLLEGE

CONCEPTS USED:
In this code, we have a Weather class that represents the weather information.
It has private member variables such as location, date, condition, temperature, humidity, and rainPossibility.
The constructor is used to initialize these variables.

The displayWeather() method is used to display the weather information for a specific date.

The getWeatherInformation() function prompts the user to enter the location and date.
It creates objects of the Weather class based on the user input. 
It then calls the displayWeather() method of the corresponding Weather object
based on the date entered by the user.

In the main() function, we simply call the getWeatherInformation() function to start the Weather App.
